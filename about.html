            <h2><span>About</span> Me</h2><br>
            <p>Greetings! I'm Durga Prasad Singamsetti, a passionate and diligent individual aspiring to make a mark in
                the world of software
                engineering and web development.

            <h2><span>My</span> Journey</h2><br>
            <p>As a recent graduate, I've cultivated a strong foundation in programming languages such as Java, C, and
                C++. I've also delved into the intricacies of web development, mastering HTML5, CSS3, and leveraging
                modern design techniques like Bootstrap, Flexbox, and Grid to create visually appealing and responsive
                websites.
            </p><br>

            <h2><span>JavaScript</span> Enthusiast</h2><br>
            <p>My enthusiasm extends to JavaScript ES6, where I've embraced the power of dynamic scripting to enhance
                user experiences. From crafting interactive interfaces to solving real-world problems with code, I find
                joy in the versatility that JavaScript brings to web development.
            </p><br>

                <li>Problem Solver: My approach to coding goes beyond syntax. I enjoy dissecting challenges, employing

            </ul><br>

            <h2><span>What's</span> Next?</h2><br>

                dynamic work environment. My goal is to leverage my technical knowledge and passion for coding to create
                meaningful and innovative solutions.
